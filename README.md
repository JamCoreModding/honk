**The Honk - a mysterious creature extinct for years...until now.**

**They're angry, they're loud, and
they're annoying. But they also possess a power that can be exploited for your own gain.**

- Mine ancient amber containing Honk blood deep underground.
- Process blood and DNA.
- Breed Honks to optimize their genes.
- Combine Honks to create new Honks of different types, such as the Iron Honk.
- Farm your Honks for the resources they provide.

Honk aims to recreate the feeling of
the [Chickens Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chickens), with some twists of
course!
