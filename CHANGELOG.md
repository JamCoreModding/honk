## Changelog

- Create a very rudimentary system to autogenerate Honk textures. They're very ugly but they're prettier than the
  missing textures.
- More speed tweaks.
- Begin the texture update.
- Add specific blood, DNA, and egg types to a creative tab.
    - This means that Honk types are now synchronised to the client from a dedicated server.
